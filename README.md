# fsValueConverter

the firestore event trigger for google cloud functions provides indepth event data, but it is difficult to
get to the document data. This package contains a single function that can take the value.fields property
and return clear javascript object. 

the value documentation can be found [here](https://cloud.google.com/firestore/docs/reference/rest/v1/Value).
